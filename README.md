# <a name="project-summary"></a>Summary
The idea of this project is take a tutorial that I found on [this](http://arubystory.blogspot.com.au/p/tutorials.html "A Ruby Story") site and make a similar one, but changing the structure of the database, adding file managment and user authentication
with the social networks using the `devise` and `omniauth` gems.

This project will be a site that allows people register, and make some tasks which will be like requests for a job with a deadline, a title, a description of the job and maybe some files attached to complete the job especification.

Once the task is saved the owner of the site gets an email with this information and then when he starts to work on the job sets the start time, once it is finished it sets the finish time and the site will make an invoice with the data from the user that made the requested task and the time it takes.
